## 📖 Overview

A **feature selection page** built with semantic HTML and pure CSS. Six product features are laid
out as a **two-column grid of cards**, each with a custom-styled checkbox so the user can pick the
options they want. The whole card is clickable thanks to the `<label>`-wrapping technique, and the
native checkbox appearance is fully restyled with CSS — no JavaScript involved.

## ✨ Features

- **CSS Grid layout** — `.feature-card-container` uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)`
  with a `gap`, centered and capped at `max-width: 900px`, so the six cards sit in a tidy
  two-column grid.
- **Six feature cards** — Cloud Storage, 24/7 Customer Help, Advanced Analytics, Custom User
  Themes, Multi-User Collab and API Access, each with a short description.
- **Whole-card clickability** — each card is a `<label>` wrapping its `<input>`, so clicking
  anywhere on the card toggles the checkbox.
- **Custom checkboxes** — native appearance removed with `appearance: none` and rebuilt with a
  rounded border, a colored `:checked` state and a CSS-generated check mark (`::after { content: "✓" }`).
- **Hover feedback** — cards gain a glowing shadow and a highlighted border on `:hover`.
- **Visual depth** — `box-shadow`, `border-radius` and a translucent container background.
